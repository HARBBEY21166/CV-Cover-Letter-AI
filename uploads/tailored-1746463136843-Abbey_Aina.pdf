Okay, I understand. Since you can't upload the PDF and need to manually enter the content, please provide the text of your original cover letter. Once you provide the text, I will:

1.  **Analyze your original cover letter.** I will identify areas that are already strong and areas that need improvement to better match the Web Designer role at Remote Recruitment.
2.  **Rewrite your cover letter.** I will focus on incorporating keywords and phrases from the job description and highlighting your relevant skills and experience.
3.  **Preserve formatting and structure.** I will aim to keep the same general layout and organization as your original letter.
4.  **Provide you with the rewritten content only.**
